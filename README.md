<h1>Current Changes: [January 06, 2024]</h1>

> What's New?: "Added a Swimming State"


> IK Script:
- IK System will not work when the player is currently swimming.

- Edit: 2 new animations were introduced (Water threading = "Idle" and the Swmming = "Moving Swim").

> Change State Script:
- Introduced 4 types of swimming States (Swim Idle, Slow Swim, Fast Swim, Speed Swim).
- Edit: might only do (Swim Dile, Slow Swim, and Fast Swim).
- Explanation: this is due to limited amount of free animations i've got.

> Grounded State Script:
- Player will have no gravity when swimming. (Prolly not the right way to say it)
- Edit: Might revert this in exchange for invisible layer that the player can swim through.
- Explanation: Some animation are glitching upon using no gravity.

> Jumping State Script:
- Jump Cooldown adjusted from (1.5f to 1f). [Apparenly 1.5f is too long]
