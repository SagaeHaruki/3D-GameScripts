<h1>Current Changes: [January 06, 2024]</h1>

> What's New?: "Added a Swimming State"
- Pros: 2 Swimming state added, player can swim!
- Cons: Unfortunately, the animation is making the character under the water, in solution to this, Stamina will affect or will introduce a Lung Capacity/Oxygen

> IK Script:
- IK System will not work when the player is currently swimming.
- Explanation: apparently the ik system magnets the player to the ground. 
  
> Movement Script:
- Added a few variables for the newly added "Swimming State'.

> Falling State Script:
- Fixed when the player is currently falling, and the is swimming tirgger, isFalling state will be turned off.

> Animations Script:
- Added 2 new booleans for the Swimming, isSwimIdle and isSwimming.
- Since there will be 2 new idle states (When grounded and When swimming).
- Edit: 2 new animations were introduced (Water threading = "Idle" and the Swmming = "Moving Swim").

> Change State Script:
- Introduced 4 types of swimming States (Swim Idle, Slow Swim, Fast Swim, Speed Swim).
- Edit: might only do (Swim Dile, Slow Swim, and Fast Swim).
- Explanation: this is due to limited amount of free animations i've got.

> Grounded State Script:
- You have no gravity when swimming.
- Edit: Might revert this in exchange for invisible layer that the player can swim through.
- Explanation: Some animation are glitching upon using no gravity.

> Jumping State Script:
- Jump Cooldown adjusted from (1.5f to 1f). [Apparenly 1.5f is too long]
- Fix the jump when walking. [This doesn't work before]

> Movement Change Script:
- Added a Dash Motion Including the ff. (Cooldown, Duration, Distance, DashTime, and canDash).
- Change the sprinting method instead of holding it. Explanation: "When pressing the [LShift], you start by dashing, after a short while you will start sprinting, to stop sprinting, you must stop moving".
- Since you can now detect if going up or down a slope; movement change based on going up or down a slope, (Exept for the walking, it stays on current walking speed).
- Adjusted all the movement speed modifier, this is to sync with the Animation Speed.
